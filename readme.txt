5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We generally had the idea of designing the app for people who would want to track their sleeping habits -- college students, people who work alot, etc.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
As we designed the app, we kept in mind the difference in screen sizes and resolution for both iOS and Android mobile devices.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
There is a little + button at the bottom-left of the screen that leads to two options, one being logging overnight sleep.
Logging sleep time entries should be done under a scroll, input system because logged data should be as accurate as possible (down to the seconds), If
people were to use an app to track their sleeping habits.



9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Same thing as above, it is one of the options within the + button. We wanted to show the users the scaling system and base their input that way,
generally because sleepiness involves a lot of factors, so a number scale would be a good approximation of the data.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
There is a button (with an eye icon) that serves as a toggle to show/hide the logged data. Being able to toggle is a good way to keep
the screen clean from unnecessary data, and give the users the option to hide it.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
Backing up logged data.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N/A


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
Capacitor Storage, with built-in support from Ionic.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
